# Scratchpad branch - experimental

This branch does contain various notes and experiments, it is not intended to be
integrated back into any mainline branch.

## Notes

Notes can mainly be found inside of [./docs/](./docs/).


## Experiments

Where reasonably possible, the experiments have been captured into Ansible
scripts. Those can be found in the subfolder [./ansible/](./ansible/).



### Issue #555 - Local development with Kubernetes

The results out of early experiments went into the folder [./k8s/](./k8s/).


### Spike - Containers in UCS VM

The work has been captured in Ansible, see
[./ansible/exp-409-spike-containers.yaml](./ansible/exp-409-spike-containers.yaml).


## Lifecycle and Cleanup

This branch should be moved into a personal repository once that's available.

This branch is of temporary nature and can safely be removed once there is no
value in interim work results anymore.
