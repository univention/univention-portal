# Docker Compose Setup

This folder contains a docker compose setup of the containerized Univention Portal.


## Purpose

Docker compose is in use as a convenience utility to ease the process of
starting the application locally, the main stakeholder is the role Developer.

This configuration is not supposed to be the App Center integration. At the time
of writing the work on developing the App Center integration has not yet been
started.


## Defined services (containers)

The defined services are documented inside of the file
[`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) to avoid that documentation and
configuration get out of sync over time.
