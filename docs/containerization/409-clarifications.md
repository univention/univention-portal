# Epic 409 Clarifications

See <https://git.knut.univention.de/groups/univention/-/epics/409> regarding the Epic itself.

This section logs notes regarding various topics which we managed to clarify
during the journey.


## Reference Kubernetes configuration from SCS project

At the moment this topic can be put aside. The SCS project will eventually come
up with a specific Kubernetes configuration. At that point in the future the
container will have to be tested in this environment and potentially be adjusted
depending on the test results.
