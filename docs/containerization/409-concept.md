# Concept Scratchpad

## Objective

> Containerization of the Univention Portal compatible to "DVS": "Deutsche
> Verwaltungscloud Strategie".
>
> Main requirements: Allow deployments of the Univention Portal on Kubernetes
> based on HELM charts.

## Concept scratchpad

Split "container" and "backend":

Container steps:

1.  Portal into container, roughly "as-is"
2.  Deployment via HELM
3.  Deployment into SCS
4.  Split container into portal app and backend - overlap with backend steps below

Q: How does UCS stack know that it must notify the container?

Backend steps:

1.  Clarification: If other backend, how does administration work?
2.  Flat file interface good enough? Stub for development?
3.  Q: Do we need a backend still? E.g. client reads out of S3 object store.
4.  Factor out current backend -> it becomes one "object store" which provides
    the json structure
5.  Would the "UCS UDM LDAP" backend become a single component which does put
    updated json files into the object store or provide the URL endpoints?


## Clarify


### TODO How are "portal" and "UMC" related?

Assumption: It seems that UMC does provide tiles into the portal, depending on
the current user's permissions or groups.


### TODO Does the current backend provide json structures dynamic or static?

Check also UMC


### TODO Container images and artifacts into registries

How do the artifacts arrive in the registry? Do we have to solve this part as
well or is it already solved?


### TODO How to get a "SCS based Kubernetes"

Speak trossner

This is the target platform, how can we test on it?


### TODO Other requirements

Speak isteuwer

Compare 335:

-   Deployment via Univention App Center
-   Deployment as native Docker

Are those still relevant? Somehow the existing customer basis still has to be
supported.


## Research


### App Center

The provider manual does describe how to put an app together.

Essentially the app is based on a docker container. The app center allows to
configure the app and also provides integration with the UCS around.

There is an appliance install which does allow to install a linux system with
just the app installed. This does come with UCS included, so that the app
container has the needed ecosystem available.


#### Documentation

-   For app providers
    <https://docs.software-univention.de/app-center/5.0/en/>#


#### Example application

Etherpad Lite seems to be a good candidate for a quick test.

Source code:

-   Debian package
    <https://git.knut.univention.de/univention/components/etherpad-lite>

Conclusion: It seems to be a bad choice in a sense that it does seem to be based
on an older concept called "AppBox". This seems to be the idea to make the
container a "Managed Node" and then install the respective Debian packages into
it.


### Building the package

See developer manual at
[2. Packaging software â€” Univention Corporate Server - Manual for developers](https://docs.software-univention.de/developer-reference/5.0/en/packaging.html)

This is essentially the debian packaging process.


### Domain join

A normal UCS system, Managed Node, joins a domain.

Not yet sure if parts of this process are relevant to containers, or if that's
provided in a different way. It could be the responsibility of the respective
container environment to take care of those needs.
