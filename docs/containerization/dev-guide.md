# Development Guide

These notes are based on insights and observations during the process from
writing code towards having it arrive in the mainline branch. The aim is to have
those placed into an appropriate place in a wiki once that place is found.


## Test and example data

- The primary node domain is `primary.univention.test`.


## Documentation

- Avoid to state the obvious.

- Use clear prefixes like "TODO:" when stating that something has to be change
  in the future.


## Commit messages

- Use conventional commits.
  - Covered by automatic linting on Merge Requests.

- Refer always an issue number in the bottom of a commit message.
