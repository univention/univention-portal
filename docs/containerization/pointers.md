# Pointers

Collected relevant points into documentation, documents and potentially
infrastructure which is relevant for [Epic
409](https://git.knut.univention.de/groups/univention/-/epics/409).


## Tooling around the portal

### Exploration

We've put a branch together with a few options to easily build various artifacts
out of the sources so that it is possible to experiment with them and understand
the portal, its behavior and its interaction with the environment better.

The tooling is available in the branch
[`jbornhold/409-exploration-wip`](https://git.knut.univention.de/univention/components/univention-portal/-/tree/jbornhold/409-exploration-wip).


## Environments
