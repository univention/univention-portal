# Accessibility: What you need to know

Definition taken from MDN:

> Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11yâ€”as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.

That means we as Developers, Managers and Testers need to ensure that the Phoenix portal meets [WCAG 2.1 AA (external)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) or [EN 301 549 (external, german)](https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/DE/neue-version-der-en-301-549.html) requirements:

- providing a clean mark up that is screenreader friendly
- creating a UI that works also with a 200% zoom factor
- using colors thats meets given color contrast requirements
- user can access all parts of the digital product by keyboard only.

*Accessibility statement*
> An accessibility statement should be provided by public sector bodies on the compliance of their websites and
> mobile applications with the accessibility requirements laid down by this Directive. That accessibility statement
> should include, where appropriate, the accessible alternatives provided for.

taken from the [EU Directive on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj)

- a users first point of contact, if bugs or questions appear
- a list of elements in our webpage that are NOT accessible.
- why they are not accessible
- our plans for the future
- the statement should be found in the manual, or on the same level as data policy or imprint
- the statement should be written also in simple language a huge nice to have would be also in sign language (sign language users have their own grammar and context logic.)

We also have to ensure, that the IT support of the product should should be accessible.
