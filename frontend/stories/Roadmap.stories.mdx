# About Storybook

**why do we use storybook and what do we use storybook for?**

Since this project keeps getting bigger and bigger, it is useful to provide a useful documentation
and overview about each component. Storybook provides also a lot of usefull addons such as "A11y" that help
devs and managers keep track about it while developing and changing the digital product.


# Roadmap

We want a nice and helpfull overview in storybook about:

**Univention/ UCS/ and the Product itself**

Checkout the [intro](/?path=/story/introduction-portal--page)


**General Architecture of the product**

The portal frondend, the adminmode, the Selfservice but also the Architecture that is behind the portal
to provide a better overview


**techstack, dependencies**

For example we use this repo: https://git.knut.univention.de/univention/ucs to create the translations (more information in the README.md)


**a11y**

The portal should be an inclusive digital product, that can be used by everyone regardless of the possible disabilities a user might have.
We have started the documentation of the A11y already, but a lot needs to be done to cover it all.


## Storybook Todos

The Storybook is a good start but has some issues, that need to be handled:

- make .js-stories into .ts-stories
- component level stylus not working (this issue might help: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/12144)
- the components are not build to be simple UI Components - to much logic is happening: https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/vue/en/data/
- build and deploy storybook so that others (non-devs) have easy access to it (ask yannik)
