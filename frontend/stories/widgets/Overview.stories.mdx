# Widgets

Widgets are Form Components that are dynamically imported through the Form Component. The Form Component gets an WidgetArray as Prop and renders each Widget in the Form-Element Component.
The Form-Element Component itself renders the Widget Element itself with all nessessary HTML-Input-Tags, that maked the Form also accessible.
