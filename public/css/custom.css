    This is the custom.css. We will not update it directly, it is yours.

    Feel free to alter any style, but be aware that upgrades can break your
    styling e.g. because CSS selectors no longer find your defined element.

    The more reliable (yet less flexible) way of customizing are themes.
    See you theme.css
