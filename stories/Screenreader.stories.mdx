# Screenreader

## General Information

There are tools out there that can help developing accessible products, but if yu are developing a new feature you should always test
if the feature is screenreader accessible. 

Depending on your System you can download following Screenreader:

- [NVDA on Windows (open source)](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)
- [Orca on Linux](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/index.html.en)
- [Voice Over on iOS](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/voiceover/vo2682/mac)

It is good to know that the most used Screenreader is JAWS. Since it is required to get a license for JAWS, we have tested it mostly on the open source version NVDA.
Maybe we can use [Jaws inspect](https://www.tpgi.com/arc-platform/jaws-inspect/) in the future?


**If you are using NVDA Screenreader for testing it is useful knowing following things:**

- Screenreader users a much higher output speed. The normal rate of natural speech ranges between 4-8 syllables per second. Frequent screen reader users speed this up a lot, some even up to 22 syllables per second [source](https://techblog.topdesk.com/accessibility/how-screen-reader-users-read-the-web/#:~:text=The%20normal%20rate%20of%20natural,to%2022%20syllables%20per%20second!)
- For untrained users the constant audio output might be overwhelming, and for that you can open the "Speech Viewer". To enable the "Speech Viewer", check the "Speech Viewer" menu item under Tools in the NVDA menu. Uncheck the menu item to disable it.
- "Audio Ducking Mode": This option allows you to choose if NVDA should lower the volume of other applications while NVDA is speaking, or all the time while NVDA is running. You can find Settings in the Synthesizer dialog, which can be opened by activating the Change... button in the speech category of the NVDA settings dialog, allows you to select which Synthesizer NVDA should use to speak with.
