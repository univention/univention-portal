# ReadOnlyField

Sometimes we need a `ReadOnlyField`-component in our forms to show, that some kind of data is not editible (anymore).
For example in the admin mode, if an admin user wants to edit a tile, he should know that it is not possible anymore to change the internal name.

Before using the `ReadOnlyField` Component, we simply used `input` Elements with the `disabled` attribute.
But since thy are not read by the Screenreader they are not accessible.
Changing the attribute to `readonly` was no godd solution either because it could've caused some misunderstandings to the other users,
since it looks like a usable input component.

The ReadOnlyField takes two props:
- label: which takes the desired input dataValue
- tabindex: wich is needed to put this information in the tab sequence.
